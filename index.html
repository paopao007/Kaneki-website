    <h2>About Kaneki</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Kaneki Ken</span> (金カネ木キ 研ケン) is the main protagonist of <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>. He was once a quiet university student studying Japanese literature at Kamii University before a fateful encounter with Rize Kamishiro turned him into the first known artificial one-eyed ghoul.</p>
    <p>Following his transformation, he joined <span class="highlight">Anteiku</span> and tried to learn how to live as a ghoul. His journey led him to earn the alias <span class="highlight">Eyepatch</span> and later <span class="highlight">Centipede</span> after surviving brutal captivity by Aogiri Tree.</p>
    <p>Years later, he reemerged as <span class="highlight">Haise Sasaki</span>, a Ghoul Investigator for the CCG with no memory of his past. Upon regaining his memories, Kaneki took on the title of <span class="highlight">The Black Reaper</span>, and eventually became the feared and respected <span class="highlight">One-Eyed King</span>.</p>
    <p>He founded the group <span class="highlight">Goat</span> to unite ghouls and humans, and after the chaos of the Dragon incident, helped bring about peace. Kaneki now lives peacefully with <span class="highlight">Touka</span>, his wife, and their children.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
    <blockquote>"1000 - 7..."</blockquote>
    <p>In the anime <em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, the phrase <strong>"1000 - 7"</strong> refers to a mental exercise where Kaneki is forced to count backward from 1000 by subtracting 7 repeatedly. This task is used by his torturer, Jason, to keep him conscious and focused during severe pain. It's a psychological technique to maintain mental clarity under duress.</p>
